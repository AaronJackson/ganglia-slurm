* Slurm module for Ganglia

This plugin was written to monitor the GPU cluster in the [[http://cvl.cs.nott.ac.uk/][Computer
Vision Laboratory]] at the University of Nottingham.

** What this module shows (so far):

- ~slurm_jobs_running~
- ~slurm_jobs_pending~
- ~slurm_jobs_completing~
- ~slurm_jobs_suspended~
- ~slurm_gpu_free~
- ~slurm_gpu_alloc~

** How do I install it?

Run ~make~ as root and it should copy things into place. Assuming a
systemd system, run ~systemctl restart gmond~ to reload the python
configs.
